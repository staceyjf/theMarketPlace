## Key Features:

1. **Search Functionality:** Easily search for books by title, author, genre, or keyword to find exactly what you're looking for.
2. **Book Gallery:** Immerse yourself in a virtual gallery of books.
3. **Detailed Book Info:** Get access to comprehensive information about each book. Where available, there are links to Google Play to buy the book.

## Key Learning Highlights

1. **React**: Identifying a use case for useRef for the modal to utilize dialog's built-in methods to control the modal. Overall deepening my understanding of React and reusable module design.
2. **Google Books API**: Reading through documentation and working with Postman to wrangle the API.
3. **Figma**: Feeling more confident with Figma and experimenting with new features such as exporting assets directly from Figma designs to improve my design choices.

## Challenges

1. **Dialog element**: Issues with rendering and understanding that adding a display property to the dialog itself would negate the close() method which meant that the dialog effectively would not "close".
2. **CSS Positioning**: Working across Grid and Flexbox to get the best of each.
3. **Responsive Design**: Trying to manage how the app would be experienced across a range of device sizes - using Polypane to guide my choices to help shape a responsive experience.

## To-Dos

1. **Additional Functionality**: Explore ways to create a user reading list, utilizing the Bookshelf functionality of Google Books API.
